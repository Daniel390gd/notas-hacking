### pista

- Maybe try to find the JWT Signing Key ("secret key") in the source code? Maybe it's hardcoded somewhere? Or maybe try to crack it?
- The 'role' and 'userId' fields in the JWT can be of interest to you!
- The 'controllers', 'services' and 'security' java packages in the given source code might need your attention. We've provided a README.md file that contains some documentation.
- Upgrade your 'role' with the _new_ (cracked) JWT. And re-login for the new role to get reflected in browser's localStorage.
